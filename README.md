# Live-Work-Chillv2.0
# The problem statement for this project is as follows:
- Living is expensive and you may want to evaluate other places to live that could save you money and provide the same, or better quality of life.
- Many people donâ€™t realize just how much money they spend on rent and that other nearby areas could fit their needs just as well.
# The Value Proposition for this project is as follows:
- We want to help people evaluate their current living situation and identify other neighborhoods that could provide better financial stability while also providing a better quality of life.
#This project uses the following Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, Passport.js, Sequelize, Node Express, MySql and Jaws DB
- The user enters key information and is shown average local rent for their zip code (stored in a MySql database)
- Future ERs would be to add local salary data, etc for comparison
